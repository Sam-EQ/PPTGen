#### II THE PROJECT

#### Background

In 2018, the CES department engaged in a multi-departmental solicitation for a development process to determine a path-forward for correcting long-time deferred maintenance of the 2 million-square-foot Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Dallas (KBHCCD). The solicitation phase for master planning understood that the demand among convention centers continues to grow for high-quality exhibition and meeting space, especially within the medical, scientific, and technical fields, and that the existing KBHCCD was losing ground at a rate that was impacting the local economy. Market analyses conducted in prior years pointed to several factors, in addition to the KBHCCD's aging infrastructure, that were impacting the center's salability. Included among those factors were mobility, transportation, surrounding amenities, and overall land use surrounding the facility. The exploration of facility data demonstrated that, as a facility constructed in five (5) phases over several decades without consistent continuity or integration of major systems, the estimated investment level to merely correct existing deficiencies would be an estimated \$500 to \$600 million. As a result of that internal engagement and discussion, CES issued a combined Request for Qualifications and Request for Proposals (RFQ/RFP) entitled Professional Services for the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Dallas (KBHCCD) — BC20-00011768 to procure a firm to develop a multi-layered master plan for the KBHCCD and a larger study area (see Figure -1 below):

**[Image from page 2]:** The image is an aerial view map of a specific urban area, delineated by colored boundaries. 

### Structure and Layout:
- **Boundaries**: 
  - A **red line** outlines a specific area labeled "KBHCCD" in the center of the image.
  - A **blue line** surrounds a larger area that encompasses "KBHCCD" and extends further outwards.

### Labels:
- **KBHCCD**: This label is prominently placed in the center of the red area.
- **Downtown**: Located in the upper section of the image, this label is positioned over a cluster of tall buildings, indicating the downtown area.
- **Deep Ellum**: This label is situated towards the upper right, indicating another neighborhood.
- **Cedars**: This label is located towards the lower right, indicating a different neighborhood.

### Key Data Points:
- The map shows a mix of urban development, with visible roadways and structures within the outlined areas.
- The background features a gradient that suggests a transition from urban density in the downtown area to less dense areas towards the edges.

### Relationships:
- The red area (KBHCCD) is contained within the blue area, indicating it is a subset of the larger region.
- The labels for Downtown, Deep Ellum, and Cedars are positioned to provide context for the surrounding neighborhoods relative to KBHCCD.

Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the boundaries and key neighborhoods within the specified urban area.

Figure – 1

A collective decision was made to draft the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Dallas (KBHCCD) Master Plan by studying the Convention Center District in **Figure – 1** as a larger, integrated economic development plan that included the convention center facility, land use, transportation, and connectivity around the facility and into South Dallas, and financing.

{3}------------------------------------------------

In January 2021, the procurement evaluation process resulted in the awarding of a contract to WSP USA, Inc. to work with the Department and its broader Internal and External Stakeholder teams in the development of the KBHCCD Master Plan. Over the next two years, through approximately 300 engagement meetings with both internal and external stakeholders, a draft plan was developed, and City Council recommendations made to move the existing convention center to the west of Lamar Street, detaching The Black Academy of Arts and Letters and the Dallas Memorial Auditorium (Arena) to function as stand-alone buildings. The expansion of the campus, and ultimate decommissioning of some portions of the existing building, would result in an opportunity to create a multi-use district on approximately 30-acres, while re-orientation of streets, the re-envisioning of the Eddie Bernice Johnson Union Station, the repair and refreshing of Pioneer Plaza and Cemetery, and reconnection into South Dallas.

The Master Plan incorporated feedback and active participation from fourteen City departments, VisitDallas, Oak View Group (dba OVG), Downtown Dallas Inc., the North Central Texas Council of Governments, the Texas Department of Transportation, Dallas Area Rapid Transit, Union Pacific Railroad, chambers of commerce, local minority/women owned business development groups, and many other stakeholders. The Master Plan also incorporated all existing City of Dallas developed plans related to transportation, sustainability, development, racial equity, arts and culture, and others. The resulting concept and March 6 reorientation meets multi-agency and long-term City of Dallas goals to reconnect and re-knit communities by expanding the KBHCCD in such a manner that it no longer serves as a physical and development barrier into the community referred to in the vernacular as The Cedars, which is the northernmost gateway into South Dallas and the larger southern sector.

The implementation of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Dallas ("KBHCCD") Master Plan (hereinafter referred to as "the Project") was ultimately divided into seven (7) fundable components as outlined below:

- KBHCCD Convention Center Expansion and proposed Enhanced Greenspace connector using the Construction Manager At-Risk Delivery Model, and the Demolition of the Existing Convention Center
- 2. Transportation-Related Alternatives
- 3. Dallas Memorial Auditorium (Arena) using either Design Bid Build or Construction Manager At-Risk Delivery Model
- 4. The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) using a Design Bid Build or Construction Manager At-Risk Delivery Model
- 5. Pioneer Plaza and Pioneer Cemetery
- 6. Eddie Bernice Johnson Union Station
- 7. Land Use and Development on City of Dallas owned property within the downtown area

The City of Dallas is seeking **Qualifications Statements for the KBHCCD Convention Center Expansion portion of Component 1 only.** 

Specific program requirements and design guidelines for the KBHCCD Convention Center Expansion will be provided to the short-list candidates during the RFP phase of this consultant selection process. Construction of the expanded convention center is scheduled to be fully complete and in-service by 2029.

A "Request for Proposal" will be issued to these best-qualified candidates. The purpose of the Proposal is to provide these candidates an opportunity to submit additional information specific to the planned scope of Component 1 of the KBHCCD Master Plan and its functional operation. Submitted Proposals will be evaluated according to criteria established in the Request for Proposal solicitation. The highest-ranked candidate determined by the Evaluation Committee as 'most qualified' will be invited to begin contract negotiations.

<u>Acceptance of Evaluation Methodology</u>: By submitting a Qualifications Statement in response to this RFQ, each Respondent accepts the City of Dallas evaluation process for selection of professional services as outlined in this document, and in doing so, acknowledges and accepts the determination of best-qualified may entail subjective judgments by members of the Evaluation Committee during this review process.

<u>Public information</u>: All information, documentation, and other materials submitted in response to this solicitation are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary and therefore are subject to public disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act, after this selection process for professional services has been completed and a contract has been executed with the highest-ranked candidate.

Upon issuance of this RFQ, the Convention and Event Services Department reserves the right to amend the document, waive any requirement or irregularity, request modifications to the submittals, and even reject any or all qualifications statements for any reason, provided all Respondents are treated uniformly.
