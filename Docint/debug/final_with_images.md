#### Storeentreprise Tender in large Contracts

(large contracts can vary)

OPP is an organizational form used to solve public works

#### The essence of OPP is that the public finds a private supplier to not only carry out a construction project but also to run the construction.

quent maintenance and operational tasks. Therefore, the public party has a higher degree of functional requirements than execution requirements for the private party, which thus has more room for maneuver than in ordinary building and construction projects. The OPP supplier has to find out for himself how, it is ensured that a building gets the agreed functions and how it is subsequently operated and maintained. This provides a great incentive to devise long-term sustainable solutions and solve the task right from the start. In an OPP project, among other things, financing, establishment and ongoing operations and maintenance are considered together in one and the same offering of a project. The significant investment is made by the private party, while the public party pays on an ongoing basis for the task, which typically extends over a longer period - for example. 10-30 years.

A key challenge for OPPs is that both parties must become accustomed to some other roles than they are otherwise accustomed to. The public party must act as commissioner, and the private party must assume the developer role and seize the responsibility it entails

OPP Public Private Partnership

#### Living Design - Sustainability process

#### **LIVING DESIGN**

Living Design enables architects to maintain design authority while accessing specialised knowledge across environmental performance, lifecycle assessment, social shifts and regulatory compliance.

Our sustainability and Innovation group provides project teams with the technical capacity and cross-disciplinary coordination tools necessary to deliver a unified sustainability and design vision, even when confronted with conflicting aims from stakeholders and consultants.

The service operates through structured meetings, workshops, systematic tracking tools, including our proprietary Palette platform—featuring practice cards that provide gateway access to extensive technical knowledge across sustainability topics from P&W and select external experts. This approach ensures that the

design intent established during concept phases remains coherent through project development, while enabling architects to confidently engage with clients, engineers, consultants, and specialist disciplines.

Q:\Denmark\Archive\SHL Design\ SUS-TAINABILITY\HJC\Presentations\241004 PA PM Presentation.pptx

#### **PROCESS INTEGRATION**

Living Design transforms sustainability from a parallel workstream into an integrated design methodology, enabling architects to deliver projects that achieve both design excellence and measurable environmental performance.

We integrate with standard project phases in five primary ways:

- Living Design Handover Meetings
  bridge concept to detailed design phases, assessing project aspirations, constraints, opportunities, and focus areas to maintain relevant sustainability drivers.
- Topic-based Workshops at schematic design ensure design intent continuity. Further workshops address specific areas like comfort analysis, circularity mapping, or lifecycle assessment.
- Palette Platform Integration offers practice cards on sustainability topics, connecting teams to up-to-date research, how-to-guides and technical knowledge across the broader firm without compromising project momentum or design authority.
- **Focused research**: Projects often require a specific deep dive into particular sustainability topics to preserve design

intent. This could be due to a misalignment with stakeholders and consultants, or because of a knowledge shortfall.

#### - Sustainability scope deliverables:

There is often extra project scope that is best handled by SHL rather than external consultants. We have a long list of services normally taken by specialists that can be performed in-house, giving architects a closer relationship with the analysis that influences design decisions

Living Design scales with project complexity. It provides tracking of design drivers and communication tools while offering specialist services such as environmental simulations and circular economy strategies for projects in progress.

#### Working environment

#### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT**

Currently a new system complying with the new ISO regulation is been developped.

In the meantime, the current system to be used works as follows:

#### 1. Working internally.

Check first if by contract, for internal work, a certain working platform, folder structure (ISO compliance, others) and/ or file sharing system needs to be used in the project.

**Sharepoint.** Projects with other P&W offices need to happen in Sharepoint, where access can be controlled and authorship tracked.

The folder structure should follow the PW folder structure, implemented by the SHL Digital team in Copenhagen shown in this slide.

Sharepoint P&W presentation: <a href="https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/port-folio-item/core-exchange-sharepoint-teams-q12024/">https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/port-folio-item/core-exchange-sharepoint-teams-q12024/</a>

**[Image from page 18]:** The image contains a structured layout detailing the storage locations for project files. 

At the top, there is a heading that reads: 

**"Project files will be stored in 3 distinct locations:"**

Below this heading, there are three sections, each representing a different storage location. Each section includes a label and a description.

1. **P:\ DESIGN**
   - This section is highlighted with a purple background and white text.
   - The description states: 
     - "Modeling, graphics and presentation files, permanent storage of deliverables (except BIM models)"

2. **SharePoint**
   - This section is also highlighted with a purple background and white text.
   - The description includes:
     - "Deliverables (for transfer outside the design team)"
     - "Design Team (for SHL and our consultants)"
     - "SHL Team (for SHL only)"

3. **BIM360**
   - This section is similarly highlighted with a purple background and white text.
   - The description states:
     - "Revit, and associated, files"

The overall layout is clean and organized, with each section clearly delineated and easy to read. The use of bold text for the labels enhances visibility. The descriptions provide specific information about the types of files stored in each location.

#### Working environment

#### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT**

**P:Drive:** for modelling, graphics and deliverables. Permanent archiving of deliverables (except BIM models), correspondence and legal documents.

P:Drive Folder structure can be found here: P:\Denmark\SHL Project Folder

Master

#### 2. Sharing externally.

Some clients want a specific platform for sharing files and documents, such as Dalux, Byggeweb, iBinder, DROPS etc. In each project, the archiving strategy of the documents in these platforms needs to be agreed separately with the Digital team.

If there is not such a system established, **Sharepoint** should be used as sharing
platform with external parties. Reach out
to the Digital team to establish the fold-\ners and permissions.

We-transfer, mail attachments or screenshots in e-mails are NOT valid methods of sharing information with external parties.

#### 3. BIM environment.

**BIM 360** is the working environment for Revit files and all associated files. If by contract you need to use a different platform, please contact the Digital team before agreeing to it.

#### Folder structure and Permissions

- Each company or team will receive a folder which they alone can edit
- All consultants will have the ability to view, download and link to any file in the project.
- Perkins&Will does not allow for external team members to be project admins; <u>however</u> we grant full control to your company folder to allow for the adding and removal of team members to that company folder.

**[Image from page 19]:** The image displays a user interface for a document management system, specifically focusing on permission levels and folder organization.

### Layout and Structure:

#### Archiving a project phase

#### Project Archiving process for the end of each phase

It is extremely important to archive each phase in the P: Drive, under Project / 09 Phase submission.

There should be a folder for each phase, in which there should be:

- final delivered material (in all formats delivered to the client, including the BIM models)
- handover notes or stage report
- phase evaluation

If the project is kept only in Sharepoint, the same documentation should be saved here:

**[Image from page 20]:** The image features a flowchart or diagram with a structured layout. 

1. **Top Element**: 
   - A rectangular box labeled "Deliverables" is positioned at the top center. The text is bold and black, and the box has a light green background.

2. **Connecting Line**: 
   - A vertical line extends downward from the "Deliverables" box, indicating a connection to the elements below.

3. **Middle Element**: 
   - Below the line, there is another rectangular box labeled "Yyyy-mm-dd_Issue_Name." This box also has a light green background, and the text is in black, but not bold.

4. **Lower Elements**: 
   - Below the "Yyyy-mm-dd_Issue_Name" box, there are two additional rectangular boxes stacked vertically:
     - The first box is labeled "Handover," with black text on a light green background.
     - The second box is labeled "Evaluation," also with black text on a light green background.

The overall layout is vertical, with a clear hierarchy from the top to the bottom, indicating a flow of information or steps related to deliverables.

- 11 DALUX ARCHIVE - 03-06-2025 1:47

The "Type" column indicates that all entries are "File folder." The "Size" column is not populated with any visible data in the image. 

The overall appearance is clean and organized, with a focus on the folder names and their respective modification dates. The highlighted "09 Phase Submissions" folder draws attention, indicating its significance within the directory.

![](_page_20_Picture_13.jpeg)

#### E-mail archiving:

At the beginning of the project ideally, ask IT to create a shared mailbox for the project and provide them with the list of users needing access to it. This address should be put in copy of all project correspondence.

If this address was never created, ask IT to do it. In any case, when a phase is over, e-mails should be archived there by dragging them directly to it. This should be explained in the phase Handover notes (see SHL Templates / Other useful tools in this document).

If nothing works, Outlook classic allows to convert mail folders into an indexed Adobe PDF document.

{25}------------------------------------------------

#### DESIGN DEVELOPMENT

#### SHL process

#### **GENERAL DESIGN PROCESS**

Detailing of project based on an approved SD phase to such an extent that it can form the basis for authorities to approve the project.

This phase is often the basis for the turnkey contractors pricing!

Undertake Design Studies, Engineering Analysis and Cost Exercises to test Architectural Concept resulting in Spatially Coordinated design aligned to updated Cost Plan, Project Strategies and Outline Specification

Architectural and engineering information Spatially Coordinated

• Architectural Design:

The design and geometry are locked.

Facade concept and maintenance

Logistics and site

Materials are decided

Detailed budget

Determination of

Plan layouts, Ceiling plans

Main Room drawings, Principle details

Elevations and Facade system

Technical spaces

Drawing scales 1:100-1:20

Area scheme, Room schedules ...

• Consultants, coordinate and develop. Solutions are decided for:

Structure: structural concept

MEP: energy concept

Fire Strategy

Sustainability: PV, parking, etc.

•••

#### PARALLEL PROCESSES TO CONSIDER

**Planning authorities:** the timing varies from country and project. Dialog with local authorities. Planning permit procedures often happen at the end of the phase.

DK: Regulatory project ourselves

Outside DK: local consultant takes the dialog, we provide all graphic material.

**User Engagement:** more common in public or civic projects, where users need to be involved on an on-going basis and provide input into the project brief.
